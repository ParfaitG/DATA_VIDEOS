### What is SQL (Structured Query Language)?

<ul style="font-size:20px;line-height:24px;">
   <li>Special-purpose, declarative programming language</li>
   <li>Designed to define, manipulate, retrieve data stored in databases</li>
   <li>ANSI standard with many extensions by dialects</li>
</ul>


### Advantages in Data Analytics

<ul style="font-size:20px;line-height:24px;">
    <li>Readable and maintainable expressive style of sentence semantics</li>
    <li>Layered in application code (i.e., R) and transferable across platforms</li>
    <li>Efficiency with set-based, logical order, and query optimizer</li>
    <li>Scales to big data platforms and repositories</li>
    <li>Complementary tool with heavy lifting of data pipeline</li>
</ul>

### SQLite
#### (file-level, open-source RDBMS)

```{r}
library(RSQLite)

conn <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data/BGCI_Plants_ThreatSearch.db")
```

### Data Organization

#### (e.g., data cleaning, formatting, processing)

```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT p.family
     , p.major_group
     , p.genus
     , p.plant_name
     , p.published_conservation_status AS published_status
     , p.interpreted_conservation_status AS intrepreted_status
     , p.assessment_year
     , p.scope
     , p.source
FROM plants_assessment p
ORDER BY p.major_group
       , p.family
       , p.genus
LIMIT 10;

```

```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT major_group
      , family
      , genus
      , SUBSTR(plant_name, 1, INSTR(plant_name, ' '))                         -- STRING FUNCTIONS
        ||              
        SUBSTR(REPLACE(plant_name,
                       SUBSTR(plant_name, 1, INSTR(plant_name, ' ')),
                       ''),
               1, 
               INSTR(REPLACE(plant_name,
                             SUBSTR(plant_name, 1, INSTR(plant_name, ' ')),
                            ''),
                     ' ')
               ) AS plant       
      , published_conservation_status AS published_status
      , CASE                                                                  -- CONDITIONAL LOGIC
            WHEN interpreted_conservation_status = 'Data Deficient'
            THEN NULL
            ELSE interpreted_conservation_status
        END AS interpreted_status
      , assessment_year
      , assessment_year - 1970 AS study_year                                  -- ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS
      , CASE                                                                  -- CONDITIONAL LOGIC
            WHEN scope LIKE '%Unknown%'                                       -- STRING PATTERN SEARCH
            THEN NULL
            ELSE scope                                                      
        END AS scope
      , SUBSTR(source, 1, 30) AS short_source                                 -- STRING FUNCTIONS  
        
FROM plants_assessment 
ORDER BY ROWID DESC LIMIT 10;
```


### Set-Based Operation

#### (e.g., group/clusters or sampling representation)

```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT scope
FROM plants_assessment
WHERE interpreted_conservation_status = 'Not Threatened'
GROUP BY scope

UNION 

SELECT scope
FROM plants_assessment
WHERE interpreted_conservation_status = 'Threatened'
GROUP BY scope
```

```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT scope
FROM plants_assessment
WHERE interpreted_conservation_status = 'Not Threatened'
GROUP BY scope

INTERSECT

SELECT scope
FROM plants_assessment
WHERE interpreted_conservation_status = 'Threatened'
GROUP BY scope
```

```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT scope
FROM plants_assessment
WHERE interpreted_conservation_status = 'Threatened'
GROUP BY scope

EXCEPT

SELECT scope
FROM plants_assessment
WHERE interpreted_conservation_status = 'Not Threatened'
GROUP BY scope
```

```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT scope
FROM plants_assessment
WHERE interpreted_conservation_status = 'Not Threatened'
GROUP BY scope

EXCEPT

SELECT scope
FROM plants_assessment
WHERE interpreted_conservation_status = 'Threatened'
GROUP BY scope
```

### Combinations/Permutations Pairing

#### (e.g., balanced longitudinal panel and  time series)

```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT m.major_group
     , y.assessment_year
FROM 
  (SELECT DISTINCT major_group FROM plants_assessment) m
CROSS JOIN
  (SELECT DISTINCT assessment_year FROM plants_assessment) y
WHERE m.major_group IS NOT NULL
  AND y.assessment_year IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY m.major_group
       , y.assessment_year
```


### Aggregation

#### (e.g., summary stats and diagnostics)

```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT p.major_group
     , COUNT(DISTINCT p.family) AS unq_families
     , COUNT(DISTINCT p.genus) AS unq_genera
     , COUNT(p.plant_name) AS count_plants
     , MIN(p.assessment_year) AS min_year
     , MAX(p.assessment_year) AS max_year
     
FROM plants_assessment p
GROUP BY p.major_group
```


```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT p.interpreted_conservation_status
     , COUNT(DISTINCT p.family) AS unq_families
     , COUNT(DISTINCT p.genus) AS unq_genera
     , COUNT(p.plant_name) AS count_pants
     , MIN(p.assessment_year) AS min_year
     , MAX(p.assessment_year) AS max_year
     
FROM plants_assessment p
GROUP BY p.interpreted_conservation_status
```

```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT p.major_group
     , p.interpreted_conservation_status
     , COUNT(DISTINCT p.family) AS unq_families
     , COUNT(DISTINCT p.genus) AS unq_genera
     , COUNT(p.plant_name) AS count_plants
     , MIN(p.assessment_year) AS min_year
     , MAX(p.assessment_year) AS max_year
     
FROM plants_assessment p
GROUP BY p.major_group
       , p.interpreted_conservation_status
```


### Reshape Data

#### (e.g., reporting/presentation)

```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT p.major_group
     , SUM(p.assessment_year == 2015) AS count_plants_2015
     , SUM(p.assessment_year == 2016) AS count_plants_2016
     , SUM(p.assessment_year == 2017) AS count_plants_2017
     , SUM(p.assessment_year == 2018) AS count_plants_2018
     , SUM(p.assessment_year == 2019) AS count_plants_2019
     , SUM(p.assessment_year == 2020) AS count_plants_2020
FROM plants_assessment p
WHERE p.interpreted_conservation_status = 'Threatened' 
GROUP BY p.major_group
```

```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT p.major_group
     , COUNT(*) AS count_plants
     , SUM(p.interpreted_conservation_status = 'Threatened') AS count_threatened_plants
     , SUM(p.interpreted_conservation_status = 'Not Threatened') AS count_not_threatened_plants
FROM plants_assessment p
WHERE p.assessment_year >= 2015
GROUP BY p.major_group
```


### Common Table Expression (CTE) And Window Functions

#### (e.g., running calculations, lead/lag variables, moving averages)

```{sql connection=conn}
WITH sub AS 
  (SELECT p.major_group
     , p.interpreted_conservation_status
     , COUNT(DISTINCT p.family) AS unq_families
     , COUNT(DISTINCT p.genus) AS unq_genera
     , COUNT(p.plant_name)*1.00 AS count_plants
     , MIN(p.assessment_year) AS min_year
     , MAX(p.assessment_year) AS max_year
   FROM plants_assessment p
   GROUP BY p.major_group
          , p.interpreted_conservation_status
  ) 
  
SELECT sub.major_group
     , sub.interpreted_conservation_status
     , sub.count_plants
     , ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY sub.major_group
                         ORDER BY sub.count_plants DESC) AS rn
     , SUM(sub.count_plants) OVER(PARTITION BY sub.major_group) AS group_sum
     , ROUND(sub.count_plants / SUM(sub.count_plants) 
                                OVER(PARTITION BY sub.major_group), 4) * 100 AS pct_total
     , SUM(sub.count_plants) OVER(PARTITION BY sub.major_group
                                  ORDER BY sub.count_plants DESC) AS run_sum
FROM sub
ORDER BY sub.major_group
       , sub.count_plants DESC
```

### Interval, Lateral, and Range Join

#### (e.g., log files, event/time studies, tracking data)

```{sql connection=conn}
WITH sub AS 
  (SELECT p.major_group
     , p.assessment_year
     , COUNT(DISTINCT p.family) AS unq_families
     , COUNT(DISTINCT p.genus) AS unq_genera
     , COUNT(p.plant_name)*1.00 AS count_plants
     , MIN(p.assessment_year) AS min_year
     , MAX(p.assessment_year) AS max_year
   FROM plants_assessment p
   WHERE p.interpreted_conservation_status = 'Threatened' 
   GROUP BY p.major_group
          , p.assessment_year
  ) 
  
SELECT s1.major_group
     , s1.assessment_year AS year1
     , s2.assessment_year AS year2
     , s1.count_plants AS count_plants_y1
     , s2.count_plants AS count_plants_y2
     , ROUND((s2.count_plants - s1.count_plants) / s2.count_plants, 2) AS year_pct_change
FROM sub s1
INNER JOIN sub  s2
  ON  s1.major_group = s2.major_group 
  AND s1.assessment_year = (s2.assessment_year - 1)
ORDER BY s1.major_group
       , s1.assessment_year DESC
       , s2.assessment_year DESC
```

```{r}
dbDisconnect(conn)
rm(conn)
